# Vendor Performance Analysis and Visualization

This project provides a complete analysis of vendor performance by integrating purchase and sales data, generating insightful KPIs, and visualizing the results using both Python and Power BI.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to help stakeholders understand which vendors and brands are performing well based on various business metrics such as:

- Total Purchase and Sales
- Profitability (Gross Profit, Profit Margin)
- Vendor Contribution to Spend
- Stock Turnover Rate
- Freight Cost Impact

---

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Power BI (interactive dashboard)
- SQLite (data storage)
- SQL (data merging)
- Jupyter Notebooks (EDA & visualization)

---

## KPIs Calculated

- Gross Profit
- Profit Margin (%)
- Stock Turnover
- Sales to Purchase Ratio
- Freight Cost
- Purchase Contribution (%)
- Late Deliveries

## Business Questions Answered (EDA Focus)

The following key questions were explored and visualized using the dataset:

1. Which vendors and brands demonstrate the highest sales performance?
2. Which vendors contribute the most to total purchase dollars?
3. How much of total procurement is dependent on the top vendors?
4. Identify brands that need promotional or pricing adjustments (i.e., lower sales but higher profit margins).
5. Does purchasing in bulk reduce the unit price? What is the optimal purchase volume for cost saving?
6. Which vendors have low inventory turnover, indicating excess stock and slow-moving products?

These questions guided the design of both the EDA and the Power BI dashboard.
